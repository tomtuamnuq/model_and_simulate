# model_and_simulate

The book Modellbildung und Simulation: Eine anwendungsorientierte Einführung contains some interesting topics. It describes the models and implementation ideas. To further dive into the simulations, this repo holds implementations of the presented models in Python. 

I am doing the course 01610 at FernUniversität in Hagen. It is about the book. This repo does not contain any solutions to exercises of the course.

The folder simulation contains individual projects.
Microscopic modeling of road traffic is the implementation of Chapter 8.
Molekulardynamics is the implementation of Chapter 13.
