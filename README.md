# model_and_simulate

The book *Modellbildung und Simulation: Eine anwendungsorientierte Einf체hrung* contains some interesting topics. It describes the models and implementation ideas. To further dive into the simulations, this repo holds implementations of the presented models in Python. 

I would like to acknowledge the work of Hans-Joachim Bungartz, Stefan Zimmer and Dirk Pfl체ger. The book *Modellbildung und Simulation: Eine anwendungsorientierte Einf체hrung (eXamen.press)* is very instructive, inspiring and understandable. It's really enjoyable to read!

I am doing the course **01610** at FernUniversit채t in Hagen. It uses the above mentioned book to explain the basics of simulations at a university level. This repo does not contain any solutions to exercises of the course.

The folder simulation contains individual projects.  
Microscopic modeling of road traffic is the implementation of Chapter 8.  
The visualization is done with Pygame. Please execute the file visualization.py to see the simulation.

Molekulardynamics is the implementation of Chapter 13.
